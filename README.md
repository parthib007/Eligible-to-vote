# Eligible-to-vote
This is my 2nd C program in GitHub
User have to enter an age and the program will check if he/she is eligible to vote or not. The voting conditions are based on Indian system.
You can change according to your country system by just changing the number in the if(....) part.
Hope you like it. It's a simpler one :P
